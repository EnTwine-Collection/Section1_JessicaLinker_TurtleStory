Turtle Story: An Irreverent Twine Game
This repository contains the following:
1. The twine code for Turtle Story, which should be played with students after the instructor reads the accompanying article from Entwine. This is an .html file.
2. Image files for each page. These should be uploaded into the same folder as Turtle Story, which can be run from the desktop or uploaded to the internet.
